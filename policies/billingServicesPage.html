                <h3>Billing Services</h3>

                <h4>Charges and Payment</h4>
                <p>
                    We accept payment through Medicare and self-payment by check, money order, or credit card. We will take private insurances such as Humana, Aethna
                    and UnitedHealth - on a case-by-case basis. Since we are a non-participating provider with many private insurance companies, your co-pay may be higher
                    if you choose to use us. You will be notified of your possible financial obligations prior to the start of services. If there is any change in financial responsibility,
                    the information will be communicated to you verbally and in writing. If you are responsible for paying any part of your bill, you will be notified in advance and
                    you will receive a detailed invoice for services provided. If you have any questions about charges you have been billed, please contact our main office and ask
                    for the Billing Department.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Billing Medicare</h4>
                <p>
                    If you choose to use Medicare as your source of payment, our Agency will bill medicare for services on your behalf. We will accept the Medicare allowable
                    amount as payment in full and you will not have any additional financial obligation to pay for Agency services as long as you meet the qualifying requirements
                    and did not request for additional private nursing or therapy services. You may receive a "Medicare Summary Notice" or "MSN" in the mail. The MSN is not a
                    bill - it is a notice that people with traditional Medicare receive every 3 months for their Medicare Part A and Part B Services, which shows all your services or
                    supplies that providers billed on your behalf to Medicare in addition to what Medicare paid. When you receive services from us, Linil Visiting Nurses, Inc. will
                    appear on your MSN.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Clinical Payment</h4>
                <p>
                    We take care of all matters regarding the payment of our employees - please do not render payment directly to our employees. At the conclusion of each visit, our
                    employee submit a form to you to sign to verify services provided. You should only sign for the day that service is rendered- do not sign for additional dates or times.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Charges in Insurance</h4>
                <p>
                    We will verify your insurance prior to starting services. During the consent process, you authorize us to check your insurance on a monthly basis. If your insurance
                    coverage changes at any time, please notify our agency as soon as possible. A change in your insurance may result in a change in your coverage for home healthcare.
                    If you neglect to inform us about a change in your insurance, you may be liable for additional charges and cost that are no longer covered by insurance. If you have any
                    questions, be sure to ask you RN Case Manager. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Your Informed Consent</h4>
                <p>
                    Prior to the start of services and as part of the admission process, we will ask you for your consent to treat you, release information pertinent to your care to payers
                    and other healthcare providers, and to allow us to collect payments from insurance companies on your behalf. We document your authorization in this matter using our
                    Home Healthcare Consent and Service Agreement form. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the consent, what the mean, do not hesitate to ask your case
                    manager, any of your nurses or therapists, or contact our main office. You will be given copies of the consent form to keep for your own records. You or your representative
                    must sign these forms before you can be admitted for care.
